Automatic differentiation
=====

### Ways to get derivatives on a computer:
- finite element approximation: `(f(x + epsilon) - f(x)) / epsilon`
- symbolic (maybe from computer algebra): `(d/dx) exp(ax) = a* exp(ax)`
- AD: algorithmic or automatic differentiation: use new versions of "a", "x", and "exp" to track derivative information through `exp(ax)`.

### Successful uses of AD in statistical software:

- ADMB, which grew into TMB, which uses AD via CppAD package.
- Stan has its own AD system.

### NIMBLE plan:

- Code-generate C++ for CppAD.
    - This is largely built but involves a lot of code infrastructure.
- The gives us access to multiple orders of derivatives
- We plan to implement
    - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo: It works!
    - Langevin sampler: It works!
    - Laplace approximation: It is drafted!
    - Caveat: These are all complex methods and there is lots of testing, debugging, and efficiency improvement to do.
- Capability to access derivatives for "arbitrary" (within sense) nimbleFunctions and for subsets of model calculations will enable a lot of flexible algorithm development.

nCompiler
=====

The "NIMBLE compiler" has been very successful!

The "NIMBLE compiler" has many limitations!

We are re-designing the "NIMBLE compiler" from the ground up with some of the following goals:

- Be a stand-along R development tool.
- Clarify class / function programming concepts.
- Integrate with Rcpp more thoroughly.
- Support parallelization natively.
- Support saving / loading of compiled objects natively.
- Support automatic differentiation natively
- Generate R and C++ code into R package structure.
- Swap into NIMBLE in place of the current "NIMBLE compiler."

Greater capability for domain-application packages
=====

We want people to be able more easily to build R packages for specific types of models or methods.

- Custom MCMC configuration (works)
- Expansion / plug-in of model macros or modules

Greater efficiency at various stages
=====

- Faster model building and compilation
- Reduced memory footprint
- Greater scalability
- Always, greater run-time efficiency!
