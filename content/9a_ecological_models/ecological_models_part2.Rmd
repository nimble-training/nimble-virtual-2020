Occupancy models in `nimbleEcology`
=====

- `probOcc` = probability the site is occupied
- `probDetect[t]` = detection probability at time t.

### Variants

- `dOcc_s`: time-independent (scalar) detection probability
- `dOcc_v`: time-varying (vector) detection probability

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
y[i, 1:T] ~ dOcc_v(probOcc = psi[i], 
                   probDetect = p[i, 1:T], len = T)
```

- `i` indexes site.

Dynamic occupancy models in `nimble`
=====

- `probPersist[t]` = persistence probability (occupied $\rightarrow$ occupied)
- `probColonize[t]` = colonization probability (unoccupied $\rightarrow$ occupied)
- `p[t, k]` = detection probability in year (primary) t, sampling visit k (secondary occasion)
- `start[t]` = first sampling occasion in year t.
- `end[t]` = last sampling occasion in year t.

### Variants

- `dDynOcc_[s|v][s|v][s|v|m]`
- first `[s|v]` is for persistence probability (time-independent or time-varying)
- second `[s|v]` is for colonization probability (time-independent or time-varying)
- third `[s|v|m]` is for detection probability (time-independent, time-varying, or time-visit-varying)

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
y[1:num_sites, 1:num_years] ~ dDynOcc_svv(probPersist = psi, 
                                          probColonize = gamma[1:num_years],
                                          p = p[1:num_years])
```

N-mixture models in `nimble`
=====

Poisson-binomial mixture distribution of abundance.

- `lambda` = Poisson mean
- `prob[k]` = detection probability on visit `k`.
- `Nmin` = start of summation range (or -1)
- `Nmax` = end of summation range (or -1)
- `len` = number of counts (visits)

If `Nmin` and `Nmax` are both `-1`, a range of summation is determined automatically.

### Variants

- `dNmixture_s` : time-independent detection probability (scalar)
- `dNmixture_v` : time-varying detection probability (vector)

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
y[i, 1:num_visits] ~ dNmixture_v(lambda[i],
                                 prob[1:num_visits],
                                 Nmin = -1, Nmax = -1,
                                 len = num_visits)
```

More about marginalizing vs. sampling
=====

So far, writing marginalized distributions has been more efficient than not.

`dDynOcc` and `dNmixture` illustrate why sometimes MCMC sampling is more efficient.

MCMC sampling is a form of Monte Carlo integration.

If marginalization over latent states is computationally costly, MCMC sampling of latent states may be better.

Deterministic model nodes represent "caching" of intermediate calculations.  That can create efficiency.

Some marginalizations or steps in them can be written directly in model code to create caching.

Much remains to be explored on these topics.

See Ponisio et al. (linked above) and [slides with our results](nimble_ecological_examples.pdf).

Closed-population single-season SCR example (wolverines)
=====

- Wolverines (gulo gulo) in Norway
- Data from Milleret, Dupont, Bonenfont, Brøseth, Flagstad, Sutherland, and Bischof.2019. A local evaluation of the individual state-space to scale up Bayesian spatial capture-recapture. Ecology and Evolution 9:352–363
- Data originally from Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA) and RovQuant (NMBU)
- January-May 2012
- 196 female wolverines detected
- 453 detections
- Spatial area of >200,000 square km
- >10000 detectors
- Data augmentation to estimate total population size.
- A subset of data from a much larger study.
- JAGS without local trap calculations ran for 30 days before crashing.

Improvements to the wolverine SCR model
=====

- (1) Vectorize some calculations and create habitat mask distribution
- (2)Jointly sample activity-center dimensions
- (3a) Restrict calculations to local detectors
- (3b) Custom distribution with sparse data representation
- (4) Data augmentation: skip unnecessary calculations for non-real individuals.

Vectorize some calculations
=====

### Conventional code would look something like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:n.nindividuals) {
  for(j in 1:n.detectors) {
    d2[i, j] <- (sxy[i,1] - detector.xy[j,1])^2 + (sxy[i,2] - detector.xy[j,2])^2
    p[i, j] <- p0 * exp(alpha * d2[i,j])
    y[i, j] <- dbern(prob = p[i, j]*z[i], size = trials[j]) # z[i] is latent state
  }
}
```

Comments:

- There are very many nodes.
- Every time `sxy[i, 1]` or `sxy[i, 2]` is changed (in a sampler),  distances to all detectors, their detection probabilities, and related data log probabilities need to be calculated.

### Alternative with vectorized declarations:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:n.individuals) {
  d2[i, 1:n.detectors] <- (sxy[i,1] - detector.xy[1:n.detectors,1])^2 +
    (sxy[i,2] - detector.xy[1:n.detectors,2])^2
  p[i, 1:n.detectors] <- p0 * exp(alpha * d2[i,1:n.detectors])
  y[i, 1:n.detectors] ~ dBernoulliVector(prob = p[i,1:n.detectors]*z[i],
                                         trials =  trials[1:n.detectors])
```

This creates fewer nodes, faster building steps, and potentially faster execution.

### `dBernoulliVector` is very simple:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dBernoulliVector <- nimbleFunction(
  run = function(x = double(1), prob = double(1),
                 trials = double(1), log = integer(0)) {
    returnType(double(0))
    logProb <- sum(dbinom(x, prob = prob, size = trials, log = TRUE))
    return(logProb)
  }
)
```

Habitat mask distribution
=====

This idea can be done relatively easily directly in model code.  However, doing it with a custom distribution:

- may simplify, clarify, and be more generalizable,
- could be turned into a prior, which can create efficiency.
    - in most samplers, when a prior log probability is -Inf (i.e. the value has probability = 0 and hence is not allowed by the prior), subsequent calculations are skipped.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sxy[i,1] ~ dunif(0, x.max)
sxy[i,2] ~ dunif(0, y.max)
ones[i] ~ dHabitat(sxy = sxy[i,1:2],
                   lower = lowerCoords[1:2],
                   upper = upperCoords[1:2], 
                   habitat = habitat.mx[1:y.max,1:x.max])
```

```{r, val=FALSE}
dHabitat <- nimbleFunction(
  run = function(x = double(0), sxy = double(1), lower = double(1),
                   upper = double(1), habitat = double(2), log = double()) {
    if(sxy[1] < lower[1]) return(-Inf)
    if(sxy[1] > upper[1]) return(-Inf)
    if(sxy[2] < lower[2]) return(-Inf)
    if(sxy[2] > upper[2]) return(-Inf)
    returnType(double())
    if(habitat[trunc(sxy[2])+1, trunc(sxy[1])+1] == 0) return(-Inf) else return(0)
  }
)
```

Jointly sampler activity center coordinates
=====

```{r}
# example for i = 1.  In general we would programmatically do this for all i.
mcmcConf$removeSamplers('s[1, 1:2]')
mcmcConf$addSampler(target = c('s[1, 1]', 's[1, 2]'),
                    type = "RW_block",
                    control = list(adaptScaleOnly = TRUE))
```

- This makes sense because the two coordinates of an activity center location share exactly the same dependencies.

Restrict calculations to local detectors and use sparse data representation
=====

- This code will benefit from revision and renaming.

```{r}
for(i in 1:n.individuals) {
  y[i,1:n.detectors] ~
    dBernoulliVector3(pZero = p0, 
                      sxy = sxy[i,1:2],
                      sigma = sigma, 
                      nbDetections = nbDetections[i],
                      yDets = yDets[i,1:nMaxDetectors],
                      detector.xy = detector.xy[1:n.detectors,1:2],
                      trials = trials[1:n.detectors],
                      detectorIndex = detectorIndex[1:n.cells,1:maxNBDets],
                      nDetectorsLESS = nDetectorsLESS[1:n.cells],
                      ResizeFactor = ResizeFactor, 
                      maxNBDets = maxNBDets,
                      habitatID = habitatIDDet[1:y.maxDet,1:x.maxDet],
                      indicator = z[i])
}
```

- `pZero` is probability of detection at distance = 0.
- `sxy` is location (of activity center)
- `sigma` is detection decay parameter.

What does this custom "distribution" do?
=====

Actual code would be a bit of slog.  I'll use an outline of key ideas instead:

### Sparse data representation

1. The "data" `y[i, 1:n.detectors]` is a vector of counts (detections) *only where detections occurred*.
2. `n.detectors` is maximum (over individuals) number of detectors where an individual has been seen.
3. `nbDetections[i]` is the number of non-zero counts (detections).
4. `yDets[i, 1:n.detectors]` gives the detector IDs corresponding to `y[i, 1:n.detectors]`.
5. Only the first `nbDetections[i]` entries in `y[i, 1:n.detectors]` and `yDets[i, 1:n.detectors]` are used.

### Use local detectors only ("LESS")

We want a system so that we only scan (pre-calculated) detectors that are within a  maximum reasonable range of the activity center.

"Maximum reasonable range" must be something bigger than we expect the model to estimate.

1. habitatIDDet[i, j] gives a habitat grid cell ID (call it `k` below) for spatial grid cell (i, j).  Indices `i` and `j` can be calculated by rounding to nearing grid point from `sxy`.
2. It is important to remember the spatial area may be irregular, not nicely rectangular.
3. nDetectorLESS[k] gives the number of detectors within range of grid cell k.
4. `maxNBDets` is the maximum of `nDetectorLESS[]`
5. `detectorIndex[k, 1:nDetectorLESS[k]]` are the indices of detectors within range of detector `k`.

### Distance calculations and detection probabilities are included within the "distribution".

- This makes it simpler to also do those calculations only for relevant ("reasonable range") detectors.
- This could be a tradeoff and could alternatively be raised into the model.

### How we put it all together

1. If there are any detections outside "reasonable range", return `log(0) = -Inf`.
2. Iterate (loop) over only detectors within reasonable range.
3. Treat all data as "0" except for reported detections.

Skip unnecessary calculations in data augmentation
=====

When using data augmentation:

- `z[i]` is an indicator of whether a "virtual individual" is real (1) or not (0).
- Probability of inclusion (being "real") has a uniform(0,1) prior.
- This is an implementation trick to achieve flat prior on number of never-observed individuals (Royle et al. Biometrics paper).
- For observed individuals, `z[i] = 1` is data.
- For plenty of virtual never-observed individuals, one sets `z[i] = NA` so it will be sampled by MCMC as missing data.
- There are lots of interested data-augmentation implementation or replacement questions, but here we focus on this implementation.
- Sampling cost:
    - On every MCMC iteration, every `z[i]` will be updated (could customize!).
    - For low detection probabilities, we need lots of `z[i]`s!
    - Every update to every `z[i]` invokes dependencies through detector distances, detection probabilities, and probabilities of always all-zero "data".
    - But if `z[i] = 0`, the resulting data probability can be exceedingly simple:
        - If there are any detections, the log probability is `-Inf` (in principle, but this doesn't happen because augmented individuals always have all zeros.).
        - If there are no detections, the log probability is `log(1) = 0`.  No distance calculations are needed.

### Efficient implementation:

- The user-defined distribution takes the indicator node as input.
- If indicator = 0, all calculations are short-cut.
- In the wolverine example, this helps substantially.

Open-population multi-season spatial capture-recapture example
=====

- From Torbjørn Ergon and Beth Gardner (2014). “Separating mortality and emigration: modelling space use, dispersal and survival with robust-design spatial capturerecapture data”. Methods in Ecology and Evolution 5: 1327–1336.
- Field voles (Microtus agrestis)
- 192 traps
- 4 primary trapping periods (21-23 days)
- 3-5 secondary trap checks (12 hours)
- Survival, dispersal of activity centers, and detection modeled.

Improvements to the vole example:
=====

1. Block sampling, marginalize over latent states
2. Rewrite (equivalent) activity-center movement distribution
3. Custom functions to achieve only local trap calculations

Step 1 marginalization is like the HMMs described earlier.
Step 3 local trap calculations is like "LESS" described for wolverine example.

Rewrite movement distribution
=====

Original / traditional version of movement component:

```{r}
for(sex in 1:2) {
  dmean[sex] ~ dunif(0, 100)
  dlambda[sex] <- 1/dmean[sex]
}
#...
for(k in first[i]:(last[i]-1)) {
  theta[i, k] ~ dunif(-3.141593, 3.141593) # dispersal direction
  d[i, k] ~ dexp(dlambda[gr[i]])
  S[i, 1, k+1] <- S[i, 1, k] + d[i, k] * cos(theta[i, k])
  S[i, 2, k+1] <- S[i, 2, k] + d[i, k] * sin(theta[i, k])
}
```

- `S[i, 1:2, k]` are coordinates of individual `i` at time `k`.
- `theta[i, k]` is direction of movement
- `dlambda[sex]` is sex-specific mean movement distance
- `d[i, k]` is movement distance of individual `i` at time `k`.

## Big problem:

- This is in the inefficient format for writing state-space models illustrated previously.
- MCMC updates to each stochastic node (`d[i, k]` or `theta[i, k]`) will require calculations for *all subsequent times*
- Those calculations involve all detections (distances, detection probabilities) at all subsequent times!

### Solution:

Derive the distribution defined by step sizes and directions:

```{r}
for(k in first[i]:(last[i]-1)) {
  S[i, 1:2, k+1] ~ dDispersal(S[i, 1:2, k], dlambda[gr[i]])
}
```

```{r}
dDispersal <- nimbleFunction(
  run = function(x = double(1), 
                 S = double(1),
                 lam = double(),
                 log = double()) {
    dist <- sqrt(sum((x-S)^2))
    lp <- dexp(dist, rate = lam, log = TRUE) - log(dist)
    returnType(double())
    if(log) return(lp) else return(exp(lp))
  }
)
```

Now each location at each time is a stochastic node and the dependency structure of the model is *much* lighter.

Conclusion
=====

There should be many other useful advances that could be made with NIMBLE model extensions and sampler customizations for ecological models.
